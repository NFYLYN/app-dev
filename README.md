### What makes Stranger Things special or different from generic teenager story?
: * What makes this show so special? This train of thought led me to pinpoint the exact themes in Stranger Things that I love so much. These themes include teen found family, ’80’s nostalgia, small town mysteries, comic relief, alternate universes, and supernatural horror. Taken separately, each theme has its own appeal.
